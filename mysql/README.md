# MySQL Examples
Database migration feature can be used to migrate your current MySQL databases to UpCloud DBaaS. Please test migration 
feature before using it in production enviroment. You should always have backup available in case something goes wrong with migration.

## Limits
- System databases and tables like `information_schema.*, mysql.*, performance_schema.*, sys.*` are excluded from migration 
  - Database users need to be created to DBaaS before migration
- Migration settings can not be changed during migration. You need to stop, change settings and then start the migration again 
in order for new settings to be activated
- Schema changes during migration will cause migration to fail

## Requirements

Your current MySQLserver needs to have superuser that is allowed to log in from any IP address or from public 
IP address of your DBaaS active node.

After migration is done you need to change your DNS/host settings so that software connects to new DB cluster. 
With `mysqldump` method you should lock database from changes and DNS changes before you start the migration. 
With `replication` method you can allow replication to catch up, then change DNS settings and once everything is updated then disable replication.

### Requirements for replication method

- The source MySQL database should be in >= 5.7 and <= 8.0
- Multi-master clusters are not supported
- The target MSQL database should have at least version 8.0
- All databases have the same engine - InnoDB
- `gtid_mode` is ON on both the source and the target
- User on the source database has enough permissions to create a replication user and read data
- `server_id` on the source and the target do not overlap

You can change value of required parameters for example in runtime via MySQL cli:
```
SET GLOBAL server_id=21;
SET GLOBAL enforce_gtid_consistency=ON;
SET GLOBAL gtid_mode=OFF_PERMISSIVE;
SET GLOBAL gtid_mode=ON_PERMISSIVE;
SET GLOBAL gtid_mode=ON;
```
### Requirements for mysqldump 

Method `mysqldump` does not have many specific requirements except DBaaS active node has to be able to access MySQL server. Just like any other mysqldump migration you should lock 
source database from changes during migration and this can cause downtime. If you allow writing to database during `mysqldump` migration
you are likely going to have changes in database that are not migrated.

## Handling the migration
Logical replication is the default method which keeps the two databases synchronized until the replication is interrupted.
If the preconditions for logical replication are not met for a database, the migration falls back to using `pg_dump`.

You will need to manually create all existing users to UpCloud DBaaS cluster. You can do this via UpCloud HUB. After migration is finished 
you will need to change DNS settings or software settings to connect to UpCloud DBaaS cluster instead of old database server. 

## Hub usage
You can find Migration feature from Settings tab of DBaaS page.
![Mysql-step-1](pictures/mysql-1.png)
You can choose to use URI with necessary parameters or manual configuration.
![Mysql-step-1-1](pictures/mysql-1-1.png)
With MySQL you can choose migration method between replication or dump. Then you have to add source database server public hostname or IP, MySQL port, username and password and database that is used for initial connection. You can also add list of databases that migration should ignore.
![Mysql-step-2](pictures/mysql-2.png)
UpCloud will verify if migration is possible and what is the preferred method.
![Mysql-step-3](pictures/mysql-3.png)
You can track migration in more detail from migration progress window.

## Bash script usage
We have provided you with following bash scripts `start-migration.sh`, `start-migration-pre-checks.sh`, `disable-replication.sh` and `create-dbaas-and-migrate.sh` that can be used to 
migrate your database to UpCloud DBaaS. You can monitor migration status and UpCloud DBaaS status with `monitor-dbaas.sh`. 

You can migrate your database to UpCloud DBaaS with `create-dbaas-and-migrate.sh` if you need to create the UpCloud DBaaS service at the same time. If you 
have existing UpCloud DBaaS or you want to create it via [UpCloud Control Panel](https://hub.upcloud.com/) you can use `start-migration.sh` script. 

You should use `start-migration-pre-checks.sh` script to check if migration settings are correct and what migration method is recommended. 
This script is also useful when debugging issues with migration.

### Bash script example
First you need to define your UpCloud HUB/API username and password as environment variable to allow included scripts to work.
```
export UPCLOUD_USERNAME=Your_username
export UPCLOUD_PASSWORD=Your_password
```

You should start by validating you migration setting before migration with `start-migration-pre-checks.sh`
```
bash start-migration-pre-checks.sh -u 09f499df-ec32-4cc7-b9df-86ab95d11916 -H 185.70.198.14 -U root -p YourPassW0rd -P 3306 -d defaultdb -m replication -s true -i test21
Creating migration check taskâ€¦ 

Success: migration check task created
id: b7f28f02-e25d-4be6-8dcb-a429623845fa 

Polling for migration check task result...

  "create_time": "2022-10-31T08:39:38Z",
  "operation": "mysql_migration_check",
  "id": "b7f28f02-e25d-4be6-8dcb-a429623845fa",
  "result_codes": [],
  "result": "All pre-checks passed successfully, preferred migration method will be [Replication]",
  "success": true
}

```

Then you can use `start-migration.sh` to start actual migration.

```
bash start-migration.sh -u 09bb9f50-6f52-4da6-b58f-905a0708d7e4 -H 185.70.198.14 -U superuser -p YourPassW0rd -P 3306 -d defaultdb -m dump -s false
{
  "backups": [
    {
      "backup_time": "2022-10-17T07:55:54.691923Z",
      "data_size": 1872141684
    }
  ],
  ...
  "plan": "2x2xCPU-4GB-50GB",
  "powered": true,
  "properties": {
    "automatic_utility_network_ip_filter": true,
    "ip_filter": [],

    }
  },

  "state": "running",
  "title": "updcloud-dbaas",
  "type": "mysql",
...
}
```

You can then monitor migration status with `monitor-dbaas.sh`

```
bash monitor-dbaas.sh -u 09bb9f50-6f52-4da6-b58f-905a0708d7e4
{
  "method": "",
  "seconds_behind_master": 0,

  "databases": []
}
{
  "method": "mysqldump",
  "seconds_behind_master": 0,
  "source_active": true,
  "status": "running",
  "databases": [
    {
      "dbname": "test21",
      "method": "mysqldump",
      "status": "running"
    }
  ]
}
{
  "method": "mysqldump",
  "seconds_behind_master": 0,
  "source_active": true,
  "status": "done",
  "databases": [
    {
      "dbname": "test23",
      "method": "mysqldump",
      "status": "done"
    },
    {
      "dbname": "test21",
      "method": "mysqldump",
      "status": "done"
    },
    {
      "dbname": "test22",
      "method": "mysqldump",
      "status": "done"
    },
    {
      "dbname": "test24",
      "method": "mysqldump",
      "status": "done"
    }
  ]
}
```

If you do not have DBaaS running you can create and start migration by running script `create-dbaas-and-migrate.sh`
```
bash create-dbaas-and-migrate.sh -n updcloud-dbaas -S 2x2xCPU-4GB-50GB -z pl-waw1 -H yoursourceserver.com -U root -p YourPassW0rd -P 3306 -m dump -s false

      "route": "dynamic",
      "usage": "primary"
    },
...

}
UUID of created DBaaS service: 09bb9f50-6f52-4da6-b58f-905a0708d7e4
```

Once migration is completed (`"status": "done"`) you can move SQL queries to new DBaaS service and if used you can disable replication with `disable-replication.sh`
```
bash disable-replication.sh -u 09fc3cec-fa71-4979-8aa3-ec7594cb944d
```

Please note that migration does not transfer users of source database server, you will need to create users to 
DBaaS via UpCloud Hub. Please check that all the data has been migrated before deleting data on the source servers. You 
can do the migration again if source data changes after first migration.

## Troubleshooting
If you are having issues with the migration you should check MySQL logs in source server and DBaaS logs in UpCloud Hub.
```
bash monitor-dbaas.sh -u 09bb9f50-6f52-4da6-b58f-905a0708d7e4  
{
  "error": "Migration process failed",
  "method": "",
  "seconds_behind_master": 0,
  "source_active": true,
  "status": "done",
  "databases": []
}
```
### DBaaS active node is unable to login to source database server
When DBaaS active node is unable to access database you might see following error in source database server logs.
```
Oct 17 08:51:21 mysql1-test mysqld[1024]: 10:36:54 112 [Warning] Access denied for user 'root'@'185-70-198-14.pl-waw1.upcloud.host' (using password: YES)
```

### Migration login fails and source DB is MySQL running in Docker
Default mysql docker will not allow root@% to access mysql outside of localhost. You will need to add privileges when accessed
from remote IP. For example `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mysql.* TO 'root'@'<Your source IP address>' WITH GRANT OPTION; `
```
2022-10-26T14:09:59.136938Z 1162746 [Note] Access denied for user 'root'@'%' to database 'mysql'
```
### Migration fails and connection is via IPv6
At the moment you should do migration over IPv4 rather than using IPv6. When using hostname/DNS name that also resolves IPv6 address
connection might prefer IPv6 but this does can cause issues
```
error reconnecting to master 'repluser@fda7:a938:5bfe:5fa6:0:3ba:4284:cbd9:11552' - retry-time: 60 retries: 1 message: Can't connect to MySQL server on 'fda7:a938:5bfe:5fa6:0:3ba:4284:cbd9:11552
```
### DBaaS is missing some tables or data from source database
If you have changed or added data to source database after migration finished, it has not been copied to DBaaS service. 
You can re-do the migration in order to transfer missing data.

### Error during migration
If there is clear reason for migration failure you can see it in output of `monitor-dbaas.sh`.
